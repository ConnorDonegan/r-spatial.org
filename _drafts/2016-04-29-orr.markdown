In this question we refer to reproduction of computational
aspects of reproducing scientific work, not to the repetition
(or replication) of for instance lab or field experiments.
Four years ago, we wrote an [EOS forum
piece](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2012EO160003) (together with [Roger Bivand](https://www.nhh.no/en/research-faculty/department-of-economics/sam/cv/bivand--roger-s.aspx)), where we explain
how R can help reproducible geoscientific research. Why does the
large majority of scientific papers published still come without any
reproduction materials (data, scripts)?

A lot has been written about reasons why scientists are not
very keen on sharing data and computational procedures when
publishing their research results. The answers range from
fear for discovery of errors, loss of competitional advantage,
additional efforts required, and the lack of tangible benefits or
rewards. 

Scientists increasingly publish software, shown by [exponential
growth](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/04/a-segmented-model-of-cran-package-growth.html)
of the number of CRAN packages, and submit more papers about
this, as we witness in the number of manuscripts submitted to the
[Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/),
but the number of regular research papers that come with data and
scripts does not take off.

In the [DFG](http://www.dfg.de/en/)-funded project ``[Opening
Reproducible Research](http://o2r.info)'' (O2R), we asked the
question why few papers are reproducible, and address three
sub-questions:

1. How can we make reproducibility easy? 
2. How can we make reproducible papers interactive? 
3. How can we help researchers to long-term archive their research?

The
[poster](http://presentations.copernicus.org/EGU2016-7396_presentation.pdf)
we presented last week at [EGU](http://egu2016.eu/) addresses them.

### How can we make reproducibility easy? 

How do we submit reproduction material along with a manuscript of
a scientific paper to a journal? Journals are usually quite
unspecific about requirements (create a zip file? publish in a GitHub project? upload in a data
repository? on [runmycode](http://runmycode.org/)?), and as a
consequence both editors and reviewers are faced with a strong
heterogeneity in submitted material, leading to an increase in
review efforts or the ignorance of the supplementary material.

Our project [O2R](http://o2r.info/) will propose a (simple)
standard and develop tools to helps authors, editors, reviewers,
and later on readers to prepare, review, understand and use the
submitted reproduction material. The publication cycle in 
[our EGU poster](http://presentations.copernicus.org/EGU2016-7396_presentation.pdf)
explains how this works.

Structuring requirements for reproduction material makes life easier
for everyone, and will increase uptake in the publication cycle.

### How can we make reproducible papers interactive? 

Have you ever wondered why diagrams and graphs in an arbitray on-line
newspaper are interactive, but those in scientific papers are not? If
we demand scientific manuscripts to provide their data in a
structured form, it is rather trivial to develop tools that present
this data in interactive graphs or maps, without requiring from
scientists that they understand anything of JavaScript.

Other forms of interaction that become possible with the reproduction
material is the modification of (input) parameters, or input data:
a simple user interface could be developed automatically that allows
a viewer of the paper to modify a parameter (or exchange input data),
and see how it affects the resulting graphs. This could lead to
earlier and further uptake of the research, new papers from the
reader, and more citations for the author.

Creating interactive papers may be, or may become an incentive for
researchers to prepare their reproduction material in a structured
way, and enable new ways of doing science.

### How can we help researchers to long-term archive data?

According to many regulations from research funding
agencies (such as the [DFG guidelines on good scientific
practice](http://www.dfg.de/foerderung/grundlagen_rahmenbedingungen/gwp/)),
researchers are required to keep scientific data for at least 10
years. But where and how should they do that?

University libraries know what is involved in long-term archiving, and
have their own [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) and
[workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System)
for this. Our [university library](http://ulb.uni-muenster.de/)
is full (funded) partner in O2R, and wants to develop an offering
to researchers for long-term archiving their research material.
This involves development of tools, workflows, an archiving system,
metadata management, and training of library employees.

Simple tools for the creation of long-term archives will be an
incentive for researchers to actually create and use them.

### The future

Right now, publishers are undecided what they can, and should offer
to enable reproducibility, and we, scientists, should tell them
what to do. Editors are not very decided, and are often from the
generation that oversee Today's technical possibilities. Researchers
are, ehm, pretty often inert when something takes them additional time.

In the O2R project, two publishers,
[Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com/) and
[Copernicus](http://www.copernicus.org) are involved as external
partners, and will join in a workshop on May 17 where we will decide
on requirements for the first year. Both are highly interested in
the possibilities and potential of the project. To learn about the
workshop results and future project outcomes, follow the 
[project blog](http://o2r.info/), [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/o2r_project)
 and [GitHub org](https://github.com/o2r-project).

The O2R project started in 2016, is funded for two years and employs
three full-time researchers and three student assistants. A second
phase of three additional years of funding may be requested when the
first two years make believe that we can develop production-ready
infrastructure during the second phase for the open access
transformation beyond our university.
