This post has little to do with R directly, but links to
the problem of doing reproducible, [Scalable Earth Observation
analytics](http://r-spatial.org/r/2016/05/11/scalable-earth-observation-analytics.html)
with open source software, and to the problem whether [rasdaman](http://rasdaman.org/) should become an [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org/) project. I posted it to the
[OSGeo-discuss](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss)
mailing list, as there the issue of rasdaman incubation
was heavily discussed. The discussion focused mainly
on the provenance of rasdaman open source, but I
tried to take a step back.  What follows is [my original
post](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/016153.html),
but with links added in-line.

As a scientist, I teach my students that for doing science it is a
requirement to work with open source software, because only then
workflows are fully transparent and can be reproduced by other
scientists without prohibitive license costs. Currently, working
with large amounts of earth observation (EO) or climate model data
typically requires to download these data tile by tile, stitch them
together, and go through all of them. Array databases may simplify
this substantially: after ingesting the tiles, they can directly
work on the whole data as a multi-dimensinal array ("data cube").
Computations on these array are typically embarassingly parallel,
and scale up with the number of cores in a cluster.

[Rasdaman](http://rasdaman.com/) is an array data base that
comes in two flavours, the open source community edition
([CE](http://rasdaman.org/)) and the commercial enterprise edition
([EE](http://rasdaman.com/)). The differences between the two
[are clear](http://rasdaman.org/wiki/Features).  When I want to
use rasdaman CE (open source) for scalable image analysis, I get
stuck waiting for one core to finish everything. This is not going
to solve any problems related to computing on large data, and is
not scalable. The [bold claim](http://rasdaman.org/) that rasdaman.org opens with ("This
worldwide leading array analytics engine distinguishes itself by
its flexibility, performance, and scalability") is not true for the
CE advertised. This has been mentioned in the past on mailing lists
([here](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/incubator/2014-October/002540.html)
and
[here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rasdaman-users/66XL3tmDDQI)),
but the typical answer from Peter Baumann diverts into
other arguments. Also the benchmark graph ([photo from an AGU
poster](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/attachments/20160515/49200cd4/attachment.jpg))
that Peter sent [this
week](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/016099.html)
must refer to the enterprise edition, since
Spark and Hive both scale, but rasdaman CE [does
not](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rasdaman-users/66XL3tmDDQI).

I assume that on the discussions on
[OSGeo-discuss](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/thread.html),
ONLY the open source community edition is considered, compared,
and discussed, as a potential future OSGeo project.

OSGeo supports [the needs of the open source geospatial
community](http://www.osgeo.org/content/faq/foundation_faq.html).

Given

 * the bold claims and continuing confusion about whether,
   and which, rasdaman is scalable,
 * the need for OSGeo to give good advice to prospective users
   about technologies that do scale EO data analysis,
 * the current (unfilled!) needs of scientists for good, open source
   software for such analysis, and
 * the [potential conflict of interest of its creator](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/016045.html),

I wonder whether OSGeo should recommend rasdaman CE to the open
source geospatial community.
