[r-spatial](https://r-spatial.org/) is a new [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog).

R has been used for the analysis of spatial data since the early
days of R. Initiated by Roger Bivand, structured community efforts
started in 2003 at a dedicated pre-conference workshop during
[DSC2003](https://www.r-project.org/conferences/DSC-2003/). Soon
afterwards, the
[r-sig-geo](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-geo)
mailing list was created, which in 2016 has 3400 subscribers.

The mailing list works mostly in a question-answer
mode.  More recently, many questions have also
appeared on stackoverflow (for instance under the tags
[sp](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sp),
[r-raster](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r-raster),
[spatial](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spatial)), which
not only gamifies but also arguably allows for incremental improvement
of the question, code block layout and illustration by output graphs.

A lot of peer reviewed material on R software for spatial analysis
has appeared in peer reviewed journals, including the [Journal
of Statistical Software](http://www.jstatsoft.org/) (with issue
[63](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v63/) entirely dedicated to spatial
statistics) and [The R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/).

This blog is meant to serve a middle road or an alternative to
the above outlets. I hope it will collect a comments, opinions,
tutorials, and discussion pieces from the those inclined
to contribute, and that it will collect contributions that are
valuable to this community. Contributions can be sent to me by email
(in plain text, markdown, or R-markdown), or as pull request to
[github](https://github.com/edzer/r-spatial/). Posts containing code
segments and table or figure output need to come with data and be 100% 
reproducible.
