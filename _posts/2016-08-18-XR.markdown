[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment
for statistical computing and graphics. It started as a free
implementation of the S language, which was back then commercially
available as S-Plus, and has since around ten years become the
_lingua franca_ of statistics, the main language people use to
communicate statistical computation.  R's popularity stems partly
from the fact that it is free and open source, partly from the fact
that it is easily _extendible_: through add-on packages that follow a
clearly defined structure, new statistical ideas can be implemented,
shared, and used by others.  Using R, the computational aspects of
research can be communicated in a reproducible way, understood by
a large audience.

that describe the S language as it evolved and as it is now. He
has designed it, implemented it, and improved it in all its phases.
Being part of the R core team, he is author of the `methods` package,
part of every R installation, providing the S4 approach to object
orientation.

This book, _Extending R_, appeared as a volume in "[The R
Series](https://www.crcpress.com/go/the-r-series)". The book is
organized in four parts:

1. Understanding R,
2. Programming with R, 
3. Object-oriented programming, and
4. Interfaces.

The first part starts with explaining three principles underlying R: 

* Everything that exists in R is an object
* Everything that happens in R is a function call
* Interfaces to other software are part of R.

These principle form the basis for parts II, III and IV. The first
chapter introduces them. Chapter two, "Evolution", describes the
history of the S language, from its earliest days to Today: the
coming and going of S-Plus, the arrival of R and its dominance
Today. It also describes the evolution of functional S, and the
evolution of object-oriented programming in S. Chapter 3, "R in
action", explains a number of basics of R, such as how function calls
work, how objects are implemented, and how the R evaluator works.

Part II, "Programming with R", discusses functions in depth,
explains what objects are and how they are managed, and explains
what extension packages do to the R environment. It discusses small,
medium and large programming exercises, and what they demand.

Part III, "Object-oriented programming", largely focuses on the
difference between functional object oriented programming (as
implemented in S4) and encapsulated object oriented programming
as implemented in reference classes (similar to C++ and java),
and shows examples for which purpose each paradigm is most useful.

Part IV, "Interfaces", explains the potential and challenges
of interfacing R with other programming languages. It discusses
several of such interfaces, and describes a general framework for
creating such interfaces. As instances of this framework it provides
interfaces to the Python and Julia languages, and discusses the
existing Rcpp framework.

For who was this book written? It is clearly not an
introductory text, nor a how-to or hands-on book for learning
how to program R or write R packages, and it refers to the
two volumes [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) and [R
packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), both written by [Hadley
Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). For those with a bit of experience
with R programming and a general interest in the language, this book
may give a number of new insights and a deeper, often evolutionary
motivated understanding.

Not surprisingly, the book also gives clear advice on how software
development should take place: object-oriented with formally defined
classes (S4 or reference classes), and it argues why this is a good
idea. One of these arguments is the ability to do method dispatch
based on more than one argument. This needs all arguments to be
evaluated, and does not work well with non-standard evaluation. Many
R packages currently promoted by Hadley Wickham and many others
("tidyverse") often favor non-standard evaluation, and constrain
to S3. I think that both arguments have some merit, and would look
forward to a good user study that compares the usability of the
two approaches.
