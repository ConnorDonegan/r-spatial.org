I gave a talk earlier Today with this title, at the
[EODC](https://www.eodc.eu/) Forum. Slides are found
[here](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/~epebe_01/eodc_pebesma.pdf).

The idea of an earth observation data center is really cool, and has
the potential to become the place where students or early career
scientists without big hardware budgets can compute on big earth
observation data, with open source software. The question is whether
this center will take that opportunity, or remain a business for
other businesses, with its 25.000 euro paywall around it (but see below). Also, will
it make its architecture transparent, so that other centers could
follow this and finally make earth observation research somewhat
[reproducible](http://r-spatial.org/r/2016/05/11/scalable-earth-observation-analytics.html)?

I had a couple of nice and long talks with Noel
Gorelick, one of the key scientists behind [Google Earth
Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). Noel corrected my statement
(in my slides) where I suggest that the code space agencies use
to convert raw signals into level 0-3 products is open source;
he sais that for US agencies this is not the case.  We also
talked about whether making a business and developing open source
software can really go together well, where I mentioned [boundless
geo](http://boundlessgeo.com/), [52North](http://www.52north.org/)
and [mundialis](http://www.mundialis.de/).
I had mentioned Earth Engine earlier in [this
post](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/016170.html).
Noel claims that now everyone thinks I'm an open source
fundamentalist. Am I the last one to believe I'm not?

The forum ended with an excursion to the Viena Scientific Cluster,
the shared super computer on which EODC will work. VSC-3 is the
latest, oil-cooled super computer:

### Post Scriptum (Jun 16, 2016)

EODC has other membership options:

1. a smaller level with 10.000 euro (with less IT resources, but also full data access)
2. individual developers with an individual price level, which EODC wants to establish in the next months. Within this individual solution the plan is to offer a 0 euro contribution for selected activities that contribute to the general idea. 

So the EODC paywall is of a varied height: from 0 to 25K depending upon the partnership level.
