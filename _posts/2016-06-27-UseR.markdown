I uploaded my material for the
[UseR! 2016](https://user2016.sched.org/) tutorial on
[_Handling and Analyzing Spatial, Spatiotemporal and Movement
Data_](http://user2016.org/tutorials/09.html):

* [slides (rmarkdown html output)](https://edzer.github.io/UseR2016/)
* [R markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edzer/UseR2016/master/tutorial.Rmd)
* [zip file including static figures](http://pebesma.staff.ifgi.de/tutorial.zip)

The workshop was attended well, with around 50 participants. A lot
of good questions came up from people working in all kind of areas.
Thanks to everyone!
