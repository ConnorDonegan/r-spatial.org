I uploaded my material for the
[UseR! 2016](https://user2016.sched.org/) tutorial on
[_Handling and Analyzing Spatial, Spatiotemporal and Movement
Data_](http://user2016.org/tutorials/09.html):

* [slides (rmarkdown html output)](https://edzer.github.io/UseR2016/)
* [R markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edzer/UseR2016/master/tutorial.Rmd)
* [zip file including static figures](http://pebesma.staff.ifgi.de/tutorial.zip)

Many mac and windows users had trouble getting the [units and
udunits2](http://r-spatial.org/r/2016/06/10/units.html) packages
installed, or getting it to work. I suggest removing the whole
section dealing on measurment units now, and hope to sort this
issue out with James Hiebert later this week.

The workshop was attended well, with around 50 participants. A lot
of good questions came up from people working in all kind of areas.
Thanks to everyone!
