## GDAL and PROJ

[GDAL](https://gdal.org/) and [PROJ](https://proj.org) (formerly
proj.4) are two libraries that form the basis, if not foundations,
for most open source geospatial software, including most R packages
(sf, sp, rgdal, and all their dependencies). The dependency for
package sf is for instance pictured here:

![dependencies](https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.com/images/sf_deps.png)

Briefly: 

* PROJ provides methods for coordinate conversion (projection)
and transformation, and
* GDAL allows reading and writing of spatial raster and vector data
in a standardised form, and provides a high-level interface to PROJ
for these data structures

## gdalbarn

Motivated by the need for higher precision handling of
coordinate transformations and the wish to support for
a better description of coordinate reference systems
([WKT2](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html)),
a succesful [fundraising](https://gdalbarn.com) helped the
implementation of a large number of changes in GDAL and PROJ,
most notably:

* PROJ changes from (mostly) a projection library into a full geodetic
library, taking care of different representations of the shape
of the Earth (datums)
* PROJ now has the ability to choose between different transformation
paths (pipelines), and can report the precision obtained by each
* rather than distributing datum transformation grids to local users,
PROJ (7.0.0 and higher) offers access to an [on-line distribution
network](https://cdn.proj.org/) of free transformation grids,
thereby allowing for local caching of portions of grids
* PROJ respects authorities (such as EPSG) for determining whether
coordinate pairs refer to longitude-latitude (such as 3857), or
latitude-longitude (such as 4326)
* GDAL offers the ability to handle coordinate pairs authority-compliant
(lat-long for 4326), or "traditional" GIS-compliant (long-lat for 4326)
* use of so-called PROJ4-strings (like `+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84`)
are discouraged, they no longer offer sufficient description of
coordinate reference systems
* PROJ offers access to a large number of vertical reference systems
and reference systems of authorities different from EPSG

## `crs` objects in `sf`

Pre-0.9 versions of `sf` used `crs` (coordinate reference system) objects
that had two fields, `epsg` (possibly `NA`) and `proj4string`:
```
library(sf) 
# Linking to GEOS 3.8.0, GDAL 3.0.2, PROJ 6.2.1
st_crs(4326)
# Coordinate Reference System:
#   EPSG: 4326
#   proj4string: "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs"
```
now, with `sf` >= 0.9, `crs` objects have two fields, `input` and `wkt`:
```{r}
library(sf)
(x = st_crs(4326))
```
where a `$` method allows for retrieving the `epsg` and `proj4string` values:
```{r}
x$epsg
x$proj4string
```
but this means that packages that hard-code for instance
```{r}
x[["proj4string"]]
```
now fail to get the result wanted.

Many external data sources provide a WKT CRS directly and as such do not
have an "input" field. In such cases, the `input` field is filled with the
CRS _name_, which is a user-readable representation
```{r}
st = stars::read_stars(system.file("tif/L7_ETMs.tif", package = "stars"))
st_crs(st)$input
```
but this representation can not be used as _input_ to a CRS:
```{r error=TRUE}
st_crs(st_crs(st)$input)
```
however `wkt` fields obviously _can_ be used as input:
```{r}
st_crs(st_crs(st)$wkt) == st_crs(st)
```

## `CRS` objects in `sp`

When equiped with a new ( >= 1.5.6) `rgdal` version, `sp`'s `CRS` objects
carry a `comment` field with the WKT representation of a CRS:
```{r}
# install.packages("rgdal", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
library(sp)
(x = CRS("+proj=longlat"))
cat(comment(x), "\n")
```
and it is this WKT representation that is used to communicate with 
GDAL and PROJ when using packages `rgdal` or `sf`.

## Axis order

R-spatial packages have, for the past 25 years, pretty
much assumed that two-dimensional data are XY-ordered, or
longitude-latitude. Geodesists, on the other hand, typically
use $(\phy,\lambda)$, or latitude-longitude, as coordinate
pairs. If we use geocentric coordinates, there is no logical
ordering.  Axis direction may also vary; the y-axis index of
images typically increases when going south.  As pointed out
in [sf/#1033](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1033),
there are powers out there that will bring us spatial data
with (latitude,longitude) as (X,Y) coordinates. Even stronger,
_officially_, EPSG:4326 has axis order latitude, longitude (see
WKT description above).

Package `sf` by default uses a switch in GDAL that brings everything
in the old, longitude-latitude order, but data may come in [in
another ordering](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1245).

This can now be controlled (to some extent), as `st_axis_order` can
be used to query, and set whether axis ordering is "GIS style"
(longitude,latitude; non-authority compliant) or "authority compliant"
(often: latitude,longitude):
```{r}
pt = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 60)), crs = 4326)
st_axis_order() # query default: FALSE means interpret pt as (longitude latitude)
st_transform(pt, 3857)[[1]]
(old_value = st_axis_order(TRUE)) 
# now interpret pt as (latitude longitude), as EPSG:4326 prescribes:
st_axis_order() # query current value
st_transform(pt, 3857)[[1]]
st_axis_order(old_value) # set back to old value
```
`sf::plot` is sensitive to this and will swap axis if needed, but
for instance `ggplot2::geom_sf` is not yet aware of this.
