### Introduction

As announced earlier,

the first openEO hackaton was held a few weeks ago. A short report follows.

### OpenEO

OpenEO is an initiative to define an open API for accessing
cloud-based Earth observation data processing engines, explained in
[this blog post](http://r-spatial.org/2016/11/29/openeo.html).

Five participants took part in the hackaton:
[Christoph Paulik](https://github.com/cpaulik) from the [TU Wien](https://rs.geo.tuwien.ac.at/), 
and the following people from from [ifgi](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/en/):
[Meng Lu](https://github.com/mengluchu),
[Daniel Nuest](https://github.com/nuest),
[Marius Appel](https://github.com/appelmar) and
[me](https://github.com/edzer).

The [EODC](http://www.eodc.eu/) had been so kind to set us up with access to a
virtual machine in their data center, and this illustrates the problem with
remote sensing data is that there are many and they are big.  Part of the archive
we looked at was found here:
```
xxxxxxxx@openeo1:~$ df -h /eodc/products/
Filesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
XX.XXX.XX.XXX:/products  1.4P  1.3P  159T  89% /eodc/products
```
How big is 1.3 petabyte? I often
try to relate to the latest fixed-size digital medium we used, the CD-R:

How many? Mmm.
```{r}
1.3 * 1024^5 / (700 * 1024^2)
```
2 Million: a stack of 2.4 km, or 10 km when we put them in a case.

# APIs

We first talked quite a while about what RESTful APIs are, how
they work, their verbs (GET, PUT, POST, etc), resources, what
microservices are, and how they can be standardised e.g. following
the [Open API initiative](https://www.openapis.org/).  Then, we
tried to define a simple challenge that uses REST, and uses Earth
observation data.

# Challenge

In the challenge, We didn't want to work with the large amounts
of data straight away. Instead, we tried to a challenge as simple
as possible, namely adding two bands from a particular Sentinel-2
scene, and returning the result as a GeoTIFF.

We worked in three teams:

* team 1 worked on a JavaScript solution, with the imagery in a SciDB backend
* team 2 worked on a Python solution, 
* team 3 worked on a pure R solution.

After around 3-4 hours, all teams had managed to get a RESTfull
service doing this:

* team 1 had most man power, but also most work to do; the
[solution](https://github.com/nuest/openeo_hackathon) was in the
end the fastest, because the SciDB backend is highly scalable, using
24 cores or so

* team 2, Christoph's Python
[solution](https://gitlab.com/cpaulik/s2_add) uses
[flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for web requests, gdal from osgeo
to read data, and numpy to add to images--the resulting image was
not georeferenced.

* team 3 (Edzer) used the
[plumber](https://github.com/trestletech/plumber)
R package to set up web services, and `rgdal` and
`sp` to read and write raster maps. Solution found
[here](https://github.com/edzer/openeo_hackaton).

### Road ahead

We discussed quite at length what it will take to realize
the OpenEO ambition. Adding two bands is easy, handling large
collections of scenes is not. My respect for what the people
from [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)
have realized has grown, their [award from
ASPRS](https://www.asprs.org/press-releases/asprs-outstanding-technical-achievement-award-announced.html)
is more than deserved. Nevertheless, it is isolated, closed source,
practically impossible to verify.

We also drafted service calls, discussed coordinate
reference systems of tile/scene collections, and looked at
[covjson](https://covjson.org/playground/). And one of the most
attractive ideas (for some of us): to submit your Python or R
function to the imagery server, and have it work, in parallel,
over the scenes, returning the requested summary.

Certain terms (scene, tile, pixel) reoccurred many times, seemingly
stretching across the different used back-ends but there were
slight differences - a huge challenge for an API intending to be
useful to many. Discussing the API design, we struggled with the
user perspective: is the user the analyst, or the developer? Who
do we accommodate with the used terms?
