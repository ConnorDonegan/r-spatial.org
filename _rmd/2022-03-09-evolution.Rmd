**Summary**:
Packages `rgdal`, `rgeos` and `maptools` will retire by the end of 2023 . 
We describe where their functionality will go, what package
maintainers can or should do, and which steps we will take to
minimize the impact on dependent packages and on reproducibility
in general.

# Why this blog?

The R Consortium ISC granted a proposal by the authors of this
blog, called "Preparing CRAN for the retirement of rgdal, rgeos and
maptools". In this blog we will point out what this project will do.

# Why `rgeos` and `rgdal` will retire

When loading package `rgeos` recently you may have noticed the startup message:
```
Please note that rgeos will be retired by the end of 2023,
plan transition to sf functions using GEOS at your earliest convenience.
```
and similar with `rgdal`:
```
Please note that rgdal will be retired by the end of 2023,
plan transition to sf/stars/terra functions using GDAL and PROJ
at your earliest convenience.
```

The reason that these package will retire are primary that their
maintainer, Roger Bivand, has retired. In principle someone could
take over maintenance, but that would be a large effort better
spent differently. Maintenance of these two packages is hard
because

1. they link R code to external libraries, in particular
[GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos), [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) and
[PROJ](https://proj.org/), which needs regular adaption when these
libraries change
2. building binary package versions for Windows and Mac-OS requires
frequent communication with the CRAN team members
3. both packages are nearly 20 years old, contain a lot of code
that is conditional to older versions of the external libraries and
use the `.Call()` interface which makes code harde to read.

More modern packages like `sf` (since 2016), `stars` (2018) and
`terra` (2020) also link to GDAL, GEOS and PROJ and should be able to
take over the role that `rgdal` and `rgeos` now have in the future.
In this blog we describe how we envision this to happen.

# Packages depending on `rgeos` and `rgdal`

There are several ways in which R packages can depend on others,
which we summarize with **strong** (one of: "Depends", "Imports",
"LinkingTo") or **most** (one of: "Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo",
"Suggests"). The following table lists how many packages currently
depend on `rgdal` and/or `rgeos` and/or `maptools`:


|                        | rgdal|  rgeos|maptools|
|------------------------|-----:|------:|-------:|
|Direct  strong          |  213 |   140 |      93|
|Recursive  strong       |  265 |   190 |     641|
|Direct  most            |  358 |   225 |     180|



where "recursive strong" also counts packages that depend strongly
on another package that strongly depends on rgdal or rgeos. Strong
dependency means that a package will not run without rgdal or rgeos.

# The Plan

The plan is to

1. Move, where possible, functionality from CRAN packages “rgeos”, “rgdal” and “maptools” to modern packages that have an active maintainer
2. Contact maintainers of CRAN packages depending on “rgdal”, “rgeos” and “maptools” and provide guidance how they can migrate to modern alternatives
3. Modify package “sp” such that it no longer depends on “rgdal” or “rgeos”
4. Assist in modifying package “raster” such that it no longer needs “rgdal” or “rgeos”
5. Develop proxy packages for “rgdal” and “rgeos” that do not link to system requirements GDAL, PROJ and GEOS but that - where possible - call into maintained R packages (while warning that deprecated functions are being called), and otherwise raise errors with pointers to how they can be resolved.

Steps that will need to be carried out include:

* For each of “rgdal”, “rgeos” and “maptools”, we will create a list of functions that reverse CRAN dependencies call, along with the arguments that are being set in these calls
* Given this list, we will decide which functions will/can be replaced by functions that call into sf/stars/raster/terra, taking vector representations first and raster representations second
* A reference group will be established (a “project steering committee”) consisting of the most affected package maintainers and institutional R Spatial users, and those with knowledge of legacy sp/raster workflows to explore changes that would work for them 
* Functions/methods that can be moved directly to sp will be identified (e.g. sp-spatstat coercion, sp-maps coercion etc.)
* Other functions will be rewritten into a new set of “proxy” packages for rgdal, rgeos and maptools that pass on to sf/stars/raster/terra (first vector representations, once vector established to be extended to raster representations)
* With these “proxy” packages, reverse dependency checks will be carried out (first vector representations, once vector established extend to raster representations)
* Reverse dependency package maintainers affected will be informed that this will happen, and will be pointed to reports/contingency measures permitting the elimination of proxy packages other than sp
* All affected reverse dependency package maintainers will be informed about functions that will be abandoned and not replaced
* Proxy packages will be submitted to CRAN if necessary – target to support workflows and notebooks (reproducible research) rather than dependent packages – sp to continue as a container for a very few proxified functions such as sp::spTransform().
* Old-style function calls will be finally deprecated (e.g. readOGR), with pointers to replacement function calls.

# Packages depending on `sp` and `raster`

Package `raster` has `rgdal` in `Suggests:`, but uses it intensively to read and write common raster formats. A lot of functions in `rgdal` were added there specifically with usage by `raster` in mind. The risk that `raster` will stop working when `rgdal` retires is however limited, because (i) package `terra` is being developed and is meant to entirely replace `raster`, (ii) `raster` currently imports `terra`, and (iii) as `terra` directly links to GDAL, GEOS and PROJ, functions currently in `rgdal` but needed (only) by `raster` could relatively easily be moved to `terra`.

Package `sp` currently suggests both `rgeos` and `rgdal`. It uses `rgdal` for the validation of `CRS` objects (proj4string or WKT descriptions of coordinate reference systems), and it uses `rgeos` to sort out which rings are holes when a `SpatialPolygons` object does not have a flag indicating this. This only happens for saved objects that are at least 10 years old. Both functionalities (CRS validation, hole detection) can however easily be substituted by functions in package `sf`. 

We already carried out step 3 of the above list of steps. Branch [evolution](https://github.com/rsbivand/sp/tree/evolution) of Roger Bivand's fork of `sp`, which can be installed with
```
devtools::install_github("rsbivand/sp@evolution")
```
contains conditional code that prevents `sp` to call code in `rgdal` or `rgeos`. This can be enabled by setting
```
Sys.setenv("_SP_EVOLUTION_STATUS_"=2)
```
after that, e.g. a call to `CRS("+proj=longlat")` calls `sf::st_crs()` to validate the coordinate reference system and retrieve the WKT representation. All code of the [ASDAR](https://asdar-book.org/) has been verified to run under these conditions. Maintainers of packages depending on `sp` can do this too when checking their packages.
