## Goals

Spatial data science is concerned with finding answers to spatial
questions on the basis of available data, and communicating that
effort. Scripting languages are often used for this to make the
act of communication easier. Currently, the dominant scripting
languages are **Python**, **Julia** and **R** (in no particular
order). 

Differences between the APIs and implementations found in the three
languages may come from the differences between the associated
communities, the history and the goals of the language involved,
but also from a lack of communication between the communities.
Commonalities include the reuse by all three languages of existing
C++ components like the OSGEO libraries GDAL, PROJ and GEOS, or
other libraries such as s2geometry or h3.

This first Workshop on _Spatial Data Science across Languages_
(SDSL) will look at differences and commonalities in the approaches
taken by the different languages.  Particular topics that will be
addressed include but may not be limited to

* Vector data cubes
* Vector data encodings (WKB, geoarrow/geoparquet, CF conventions)
* Spherical geometry
* Packaging with complex dependencies like GDAL/PROJ/GEOS/…
* Large data cubes, APIs
* Interoperability and file formats
* Aligning teaching materials across languages, see e.g.
    * https://edsbook.org/welcome.html
    * https://r-spatial.org/python/
* Community dynamics: openness, DEI, retirement, …

The goal of the workshop is to attract maximally 30 on-site attendees
to discuss these issues, and plan for future collaborations.

## Venue

The workshop will be held Sept 18 & 19, 2023, at the
[Institute for Geoinformatics of the University of
Münster](https://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/en).
