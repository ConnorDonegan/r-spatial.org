## Goals

Spatial data science is concerned with finding answers to spatial
questions on the basis of available data, and communicating that
effort. Scripting languages are often used for this to make the
act of communication easier. Currently, the dominant scripting
languages are **Python**, **Julia** and **R** (in no particular
order). 

Differences between the APIs and implementations found in the three
languages may come from the differences between the associated
communities, the history and the goals of the language involved,
but also from a lack of communication between the communities.
Commonalities include the reuse by all three languages of existing
C++ components like the OSGEO libraries GDAL, PROJ and GEOS, or
other libraries such as s2geometry or h3.

This first Workshop on _Spatial Data Science across Languages_
(SDSL) will look at differences and commonalities in the approaches
taken by the different languages.  Particular topics that will be
addressed include but may not be limited to

* Vector data cubes
* Vector data encodings (WKB, geoarrow/geoparquet, CF conventions)
* Spherical geometry
* Packaging with complex dependencies like GDAL/PROJ/GEOS/…
* Large data cubes, APIs
* Interoperability and file formats
* Aligning teaching materials across languages, see e.g.
    * [Environmental Data Science book](https://edsbook.org/welcome.html)
	* [Spatial Data Science: With applications in R and Python](https://r-spatial.org/python/)
    * [geocompx](https://geocompx.org/): [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/), [Geocomputation with Python](https://py.geocompx.org/)
* Community dynamics: openness, DEI, retirement, …

The goal of the workshop is to attract maximally 30 on-site attendees
to discuss these issues, and plan for future collaborations.

## Venue

The workshop will be held Sept 18 & 19, 2023, at the
[Institute for Geoinformatics of the University of
Münster](https://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/en).

The address is: 

```
Heisenbergstrasse 2
48149 Münster, Germany

## Registration 

Please apply _before_ Aug 7 UTC for on-site participation by filling in
[this form](https://forms.gle/dSRzhq6myanZjyUB6).  Applying does
not guarantee acceptance; when too many people apply the organizers
will have to make a selection. When you applied, you will receive a
notification by Aug 11 about whether your application was accepted
(with instructions for paying the registration fee), or rejected
due to capacity constraints.

Registration fees for on-site participation:

* 150 euro (industry)
* 75 euro (academic) 
* 25 euro (student)

## On-line attendence

On-line attendence will be possible and realized through a regular
zoom session (no webinar). Only one room mic + camera installation
will be available per session room. Sessions will take place 9:00 -
17:00 CEST. On-line participation is free of charge.

Some suggestions are: 

* A. Budget Hostel
    * [Hostel Münster](https://www.h-hotels.com/de/hostels/hotels/hostel-muenster?utm_source=yext&utm_medium=listing)

* B. Under 100/night
    * [Hotel Martinihof](http://www.martinihof.de/)
    * [B&B HOTEL Münster Hafen](https://www.hotel-bb.com/de/hotel/muenster-hafen)
    * [prizeotel Münster-City](https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/prizeotel-munster-city?cid=a:se+b:gmb+c:emea+i:local+e:prz+d:cese+h:DEFMOPR)

* C. Over 100/night
    * [H4 Hotel](https://www.h-hotels.com/de/h4/hotels/h4-hotel-muenster?utm_source=yext&utm_medium=listing)
    * [Central Hotel Münster](http://www.central-hotel-muenster.de/)


Tips:

* book accomodation early!
* look for hotels not too far from the station (in case you arrive there) and not too far from the institute.
* if you are comfortable with riding a bicycle, book a hotel that can rent you a bike and reserve one: Muenster is a bike city. The bike station at the railway station also [rents out bikes](https://www.radstation.de/mieten#c76) for 9 euro per day, make sure to book if you want that.
