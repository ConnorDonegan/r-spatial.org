# R-spatial packages on GitHub, but not on CRAN

A (not exhaustive!) list of R packages (typically) under development on GitHub but not on CRAN are:

* [ArcGIS-R bridge](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-bridge), a bridge between ArcGIS and R, developed by [ESRI](http://www.esri.com/) (contains binary code)
* [fuzzyMM](https://github.com/ngort01/fuzzyMM), a package for fuzzy map matching
* [mss](https://github.com/edzer/mss), a package with methods and classes that enable doing meaningful spatial statistics
* [rgdal2](https://github.com/thk686/rgdal2), a package with R proxies to spatial objects living in GDAL
* [spnetwork](https://github.com/edzer/spnetwork), provides classes and methods for road networks, using sp and igraph
